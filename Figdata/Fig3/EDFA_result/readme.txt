The file "RMSE_curve" is the result for Fig.3(a). It is a matrix with 2 rows and 54 columns. 
The 1st row reprsents the result of NN w/o AL model, and the 2nd row represents the result of GPR w/ AL model.
The 1st ~ 27th columns represent the average RMSEs of the corresponding models.(size of training dataset:[10,13,16,20,23,26,30,32,35,42,50,60,70,85,100,120,145,170,200,230,265,300,340,380,430,465,500]
The 28th ~ 54th columns represent the distribution bar of RMSE.

The file "RMSE_violin" is the result for Fig.3(b). It is a table with different categories including "Data size,Error,Model".

The four files "RMSE_NN_wo_AL", "RMSE_NN_w_AL", "RMSE_GPR_wo_AL" and "RMSE_GPR_w_AL" are the result for Fig.3(e).
