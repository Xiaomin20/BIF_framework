Files in Fig5 include the source data for Fig. 5.
1. 'Fig5_b_c.npz' includes the gain profiles plotted in Fig. 5(b) and (c). The gain_matrix_5b' is for Fig. 5(b) and 'gain_matrix_5c' is for Fig. 5(c).
2. 'Fig5_d_e_f.npz' includes the data for Fig. 5(d) (e) and (f). The 'on_off_gain_random' is the matrix for the randomly collected profile. 
The 'RMSE_loss' is the optimization precision during BIF. The 'gain_profile_BIF' is the matrix with the profiles obtained by BIF in every round of optimziation.
3. 'Fig5_g_h_i_j.npz' is the selected gain profiles and the corresponding pump DAC values during optimization. 'pump_dac_opt' includes the pump DAC values and 'psd_opt' includes the optimized gain profiles.
