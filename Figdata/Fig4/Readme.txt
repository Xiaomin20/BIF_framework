Three .npz files include the source data of the Fig. 4(b), (c), and (d), respectively.

1. Fig4_b.npz has 6 vectors, 'fig4_b_1_baseline', 'fig4_b_2_baseline', and 'fig4_b_4_baseline' represent the optained profiles obtained by the baseline method.
   'fig4_b_1_opt', 'fig4_b_2_opt', and 'fig4_b_3_opt' represent the optained profiles obtained by the BIF.
2. Fig4_c.npz has 6 vectors, 'baseline_flat','baseline_tilt_negative', and 'baseline_tilt_positve' represent the optimized RMSEs of all profiles obtained by the baseline method. 
    'BIF_flat', 'BIF_tilt_negative', and 'BIF_tilt_positve' represent the optimized RMSEs of all profiles obtained by the BIF.
3. Fig4_d.npz has one vector named 'RMSE', which represents the RMSE of each iteration.
